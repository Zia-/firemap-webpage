          </ul>
          <p align="justify">For both the fire scar detection is based on rapid drops in vegetation-related reflectance of the area affected
            by the fire burnings.</p>
          <p align="justify">Major differences have been reported, however, between these fire scar products, mainly on account of
            overestimation of the burnt area by the L3JRC
            (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1029/2008JD011361/asset/jgrd15330.pdf;jsessionid=818E9B5C51C0883ABFB0B60F19E1F101.f01t01?v=1&t=ipo3hmya&s=e3a3742945b028ebde3e25f4f95e390c35d9dacc">Chang and Song 2009</a>,

          <p align="justify">The most widely used is definitely the MODIS one. For this, the mapping of burnt areas is based mainly on the 250
            meters bands, although the MODIS bands at 500 meters resolution are also used, as they provide complementary information
            that is used for improved burnt area discrimination.</p>
          <p align="justify">This type of satellite imagery allows detailed mapping of fires of about 50ha or larger. Although only a fraction of
            the total number of fires is mapped (fires smaller than 40 ha are not mapped). The analysis of historical fire data has
            determined that the area burnt by wildfires of this size represents in most cases the large majority of the total area
            burnt. On average, the area burnt by fires of at least 40 ha accounts for about 75% of the total area burnt every year
            in the Southern Europe (JRC, 2011).</p>

          <p align="justify">Since the launch of SUOMI-VIIRS, a VIIRS Burned Area product has been developed, that will continue in a consistent
            manner the 14-year MODIS record of global mapping of fire burned area.</p>
          <p align="justify">Due to the data and analysis requirements associated with the MODIS science processing algorithms to yield reliable
            burn scar products, the burn scar data are not available in near real-time. Currently, MODIS burn scar data are compiled
            by the Active Fire Mapping Program as monthly datasets are typically available approximately 10 days after the beginning
            of each month. The burn scar data are provided as monthly GeoTiff and KMZ products for the specified geographic regions.</p>
